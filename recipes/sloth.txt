Chris' Steamed Buns
-------------------
Servings: 24
Time: 4 hours

Ingredients:
2 tablespoons white sugar

1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon active dry yeast

1/4 teaspoon salt

1. Mix together yeast, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1/4 cup flour, and 1/4 cup warm water. Allow to stand for 30 minutes.

3. Knead until dough surface is smooth and elastic. Roll over in a greased bowl, and let stand until triple in size, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.

5. Sprinkle baking powder evenly on surface, and knead for 5 minutes.

10. Transfer as many buns on wax paper as will comfortably fit onto steam-plate leaving 1 to 2 inches between the buns. At least 2 inches space should be left between steam-plate and the wok.
11. Cover wok with lid and steam buns over boiling water for 15 minutes.
12. REMOVE LID BEFORE you turn off heat, or else water will drip back onto bun surface and produce yellowish "blisters" on bun surfaces.
